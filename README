# 3 scripts to run at linux system startup, for my personal productivity:
1. open my work applications/webpages and move windows to preferreed positions
2. map caps lock to backsapce
3. arrange external monitor in preferred position (can't believe this setting is not save by linux mint xfce by default)


# What I learned
- although I watched tutorials about linux and bash scripting, making my own scripts really cemented that knowledge
- practice w more advanced commands like `chmod` and `grep`
